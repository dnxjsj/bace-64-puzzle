"A slide puzzle that turns the color arrangement of mixed 3D cubes into a data puzzle"


What lies on the screen are 3D cubes mixed with color.
But this color arrangement is not decoration.
Each pattern of color is a visual transformation of the structure of Base64 data encoded within the scrambled cubes,
and the player must move the cubes to restore them to the state defined by the Base64 input.

In other words, the “correct answer” in this puzzle
is not the moment when the image looks pleasing,
but the moment when the data regains its correct order.

This puzzle asks a question:
when information that once existed only as text and numbers
is transformed into space, color, and motion,
can we understand data more intuitively?

It is a coding puzzle, but also a visual one.
A logic puzzle, yet a sensory game.
It is not a game where you memorize answers,
but a puzzle that can only be solved by understanding structure.
